# 一些筆記

## Deploy on Github Pages

已經設定好 scripts （在 `package.json` 裡面可查看）

若 code 有更新，要重新部署：

1. 先 commit, push 到 Github

2. 關掉原本的terminal (`npm start`的那個) 再執行 `npm run deploy`，等到終端機顯示 `Published` 

3. 再過幾分鐘即可在此 repo 的 Settings >> Pages 查看（可能要刷新一下頁面）

4. 直接看 live 網址：<https://cckk2913.github.io/ysyichch/>

## 我的主題配色

找了比較偏傳統中式風的顏色🏮

- 版頭 紅色：#8B0000 `myred`
- 標題 棕色：#c6653a  `mybrown`
- 按鈕 土粉：#E1C9B9  `mylightbrown`
- 菡萏綠色：#80A492  `my green`

## 改字體 & 新增自定義顏色

1. 在google font網站產出連結

2. 把連結寫在index.html最上面

3. 到tailwind.config.js 改fontFamily

```python
# 第一版 
  fontFamily: {
      primary: "Lexend",
      secondary: "Zilla",
      tertiary: "Aldrich",
    },
# 第二版   
  fontFamily: {
      primary: "Outfit",
      secondary: "Spline Sans",
      tertiary: "Aldrich",
    }, 
# 第三版   
  都用明體 Noto Serif TC

## 新增自定義的color
  theme: {
  ...
   extend: {
      colors: {
        ...
        mybrown: "#c6653a",
        mylightbrown: "#E1C9B9",
      },
    }
  }
```

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
